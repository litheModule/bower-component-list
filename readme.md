# bower-component-list

Aggregated list of components from the [Bower registry](https://bower.herokuapp.com/packages), GitHub metadata, bower.json/package.json keywords.

Currently used as the back-end for the [Bower components site](https://github.com/sindresorhus/bower-components).

The registry can also be filtered on a keyword to only get a subset of it. Useful if you for example want to embed a list of plugins for your framework on its website. Example: https://bower-component-list.herokuapp.com/keyword/web-components


### Getting Started

- [Register a new OAuth app](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) on GitHub. This is needed since GitHub allows more API usage for registered apps.

- Set the environment variables `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` from your newly created app. Remember set the `NODE_ENV` to `production` when you deploy.

- Run `node server.js && open http://localhost:8011`

You can change the port by setting the `PORT` environment variable.
